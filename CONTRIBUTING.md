### Bug Reports

Before opening an issue for a bug, please check the existing (open and closed) issues in case a report has already been
made.

_Existing Reports_
If a bug report already exists, please use GitHub reactions to boost its visibility. You may also add additional
information in the thread comments if you have something that can help and it wasn't already mentioned.

_New Reports_
If there is no existing report for the bug you are experiencing, please open an issue and add the following information:

- A description of the issue you are experiencing
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- Screenshots, video, error logs and any other helpful supporting information
- Your Neovim version, operating system and any other software versions that you think could have an impact on this
  issue

### Feature Requests & Feature Additions

Before opening a feature request, please check the existing (open and closed) issues in case it has already been
requested.

_Existing Requests_
If the feature request already exists, please use GitHub reactions to help promote it. If the feature request is there,
but you have something additional to add on to the description, please use the thread comments to add your additional
information.

_New Requests_
If the feature you'd like hasn't yet been requested, please open a GitHub issue to describe it. You should include:

- Full description of the feature you'd like added
- Reasoning or context on why the feature should be added

For both existing and new feature requests, it's recommended that you wait to have your request looked at before opening
a PR and beginning work, in case any modifications are made to your original proposal.

### Documentation Contributions

_Typos_
For typos, please open a PR mentioning a typo fix in the title. It does not need a full description, just a mention that
it is a typo fix. It should be merged right away.

**DO NOT** create typo fix PRs to change locale spelling. I am a Canadian maintainer, and I will not accept changes for
things like `colour` -> `color`. These are not typos.

_Code Documentation_
For code documentation, please follow the current format of the plugin docs. You should include the following in your
PR description:

- What the documentation was lacking/unclear on
- A summary of what you added

### Code Contributions

_Best Practices:_

- Avoid pushing any files that are not necessary (i.e. metafiles, config files).
- Fork the repository and create a branch on your fork with a descriptive name about the subject you are tackling.
- Try to keep your work bundled logically into commits with descriptive messages.
- Adhere to the existing code format when possible.

When you open a pull request for your contribution, please include the following in the description:

- Reason for change/any appropriate context.
- Issue that is being closed (if applicable), in a format like `closes #123`.

Be prepared in case revisions are requested!

### Code Reviews

Speak your mind, provide any feedback you think may be helpful in improving the code. **DO NOT** belittle or otherwise
insult the pull request author or leave condescending reviews. Negative feedback is appreciated and encouraged for
improvement, but disrespect will not be tolerated.

### Suggestions

If your suggestion does not fall under any of the previous categories (documentation change, feature request or bug),
you can check the issues (opened and closed) to see if it has already been suggested.

_Existing_
If it has, boost it with a GitHub reaction and leave any supporting information that hasn't been covered in the issue
comments.

_New Suggestions_
If your suggestion hasn't been made yet, please open a GitHub issue and add the following to your description:

- As much context as you think is necessary for your suggestion
- Motivation for the suggestion

Please treat suggestions like code reviews. Your suggestion can include negative feedback about the project, but it
should be respectful.
